Runs on rover side, sends video stream.

This module handles sending data from the rover to the operator interface, as of right now, only the video stream
This script assumes the AC600 has been set up as a WiFi access point
On a WiFi access point, the Pi itself acts as a mini router, so by plugging in the AC600 adapter to your laptop and connecting 
to the Pi's network, you can use it to stream video

Wait a couple minutes

Plug other AC600 into another computer then connect to VideoStreamPi (password: 12345678), then go to 192.168.4.1:5000/video
